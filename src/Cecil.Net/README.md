# Cecil.Net

Cecil is an example tool that can normalize the style of SQL select statement.

### Development/API

Cecil's .net capabilities depend on Clojure-CLR 1.9.0, which is a little bit broken at the moment.

I don't expect anyone will want to build on Cecil, but if you are ambitious, you can figure out what to do from [../cecil/src/build-clr.cmd](../cecil/src/build-clr.cmd).  You'll need to unzip the [Clojure Nuget Package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Clojure/) that you can download [here](https://www.nuget.org/api/v2/package/Clojure/1.9.0).

If you do want to hack on Cecil and have any questions, let me know in person, or by github issue.
